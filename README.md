# Block 18 Workshop: Writing Test Specifications

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository for the Block 18 Workshop on Writing Test Specifications. This is where I've been diving into the nitty-gritty of test specifications, both unit and functional, and let me tell you, it's been quite a journey!

## What's This All About?

In this workshop, I'm putting my skills to the test (pun intended! okay that was bad) by crafting detailed test specifications. It's all about ensuring that my code not only does what it's supposed to do but also handles the unexpected with grace.

### The Mission
- **Understanding the Art**: Grasping the hows and whys of writing test specs.
- **Unit Tests Galore**: Creating precise unit tests for given functions.
- **Functional Tests, Naturally**: Developing functional tests that sound like real-life scenarios.
- **Edge Cases**: Because the devil's in the details, right?

### The Players
1. `multiplication` Function: My take on testing a simple multiplication function.
2. `concatOdds` Function: Figuring out how to handle odd numbers from arrays in style.
3. Shopping Cart Checkout: Simulating a shopping experience, but for testing!

### Getting Started
- Clone this repo if you want to see my approach to test writing.
- Open `index.html` to see a basic layout of what we're testing.
- Peek into `index.js` for the specs I've written â€“ it's where the magic happens!

## Your Two Cents
Got an idea to make these tests even better? I'm all ears! Feel free to fork this repo, make your changes, and hit me up with a pull request. I am constantly learning and am far from perfect.
## That's All, Folks!
Thanks for stopping by. If you're curious about licenses and all that jazz, I dont have one attached to this project. Happy testing!
